## 💡 Overview

> 🧠 *I’m an AI Architect, not a full-time developer — and yes, Kaonashi also leverages AI in its own development process.* 🤖  

Kaonashi acts as a bridge between users and their local AI environment.  
It provides an intuitive interface to run, manage, and extend local LLM-based assistants without relying on external cloud services.

---

## 🎭 Why “Kaonashi”?

The name **Kaonashi** (“No-Face”) is inspired by the character from Hayao Miyazaki’s *Spirited Away* 🎬 — a quiet observer who reflects the emotions and intentions of others.  
This metaphor fits the project’s goal: to create an assistant that listens, adapts, and responds with intelligence — yet keeps no data face of its own 👺
